# Techdegree Project 3

Project 3 involved writing the JavaScript necessary to control user-responsive form behavior. The HTML and CSS were provided by Team Treehouse.

Fortunately, I believe I was again able to meet all exceeds criteria.

Live validation feedback is achieved via input event listeners applied to each required form element (activities excepted) and boolean tests. Feedback appears as soon as the user begins typing, deriving from a true/false tests against regular expressions.

Aditionally, disabling conflicting events was achieved by changing days to numbers and assigning each event a daytime code based the day and start time.

This was an interesting project, and I come away with a greater command of form construction, form validation, regular expressions, and JavaScript in general.
