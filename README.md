# Techdegree Project 3

Project 3 involved writing the JavaScript necessary to control user-responsive form behavior. The HTML and CSS were provided by Team Treehouse.

The form provides live feedback fired on input and submit events. The name, email, activities, and credit card number / zip / cvv numbers are validated using regular expressions, and submission is prevented when erroneous content is present.

The email field features additional regex-based live feedback, including the following custom messages:

"Please add the @ symbol"
"Please add a domain after the @ symbol"
"Please add .com"
